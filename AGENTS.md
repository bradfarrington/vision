# Working practices

Brad switches between machines frequently. **The git repo is the single source of truth** — every decision, plan, or discussion outcome worth keeping must be written into this repo (this file for agent rules/decisions, or `docs/`) and committed + pushed in the same session it was made. Never leave important context only in machine-level agent memory, local settings, or an uncommitted working tree.

# Vision CRM — project decisions

See `design_handoff_vision_crm/README.md` (architecture, theming, design system) and `design_handoff_vision_crm/TASKS.md` (phased build plan) — these are the source of truth for the build.

## UI build method & design fidelity — decided 2026-07-21

- **The designed screens are the visual source of truth.** `design_handoff_vision_crm/Vision CRM Screens.dc.html` (all screens) and `VisionSidebar.dc.html` are Claude-design exports. Each phase is built by **faithfully transcribing that screen's markup** — exact inline styles, SVG icon paths, measurements, colours — into React components on our stack (Next + shadcn + Tailwind), wired to live Supabase data.
- **Do NOT run the `.dc.html` runtime in production.** Those files render via a design-tool preview engine (`x-dc` / `DCLogic` / `_ds_bundle.js`); we port the HTML/CSS/SVG into JSX, not the engine.
- **Neutral palette = the screens' zinc ramp** (`#e7e7ea` hairline, `#a1a1aa` placeholder, `#f4f4f5` canvas, `#18181b` dark, `#71717a`/`#3f3f46` text, `#1a7f3e` success). The `_ds` token files ship a cooler graphite ramp that visibly diverges — **we follow the screens, not `_ds`.** Global tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Vision blue `#2f7de1` is the accent slot only** and is tenant-themed: `--accent-blue`/`--primary`/`--ring` come from `companies.brand_color_1` via `src/lib/theme.ts` (`tenantThemeVars`), applied on the shell root. Semantic colours (success/warning/danger) are platform-fixed and never themed.
- **Topbar logo** defaults to `/vision-mark.png`; a tenant's own `company.logo_url` overrides it once upload lands.

## Backend & multi-tenant security — decided 2026-07-21

Backend is **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Data API). Multi-tenancy is the model from the handoff: single database, shared `public` schema, `company_id` on every tenant-owned row. Enforcement decisions:

- **RLS is the enforcement layer, Supabase-native.** Each user's `company_id` (and role) is stamped into their JWT `app_metadata` by a custom access-token hook (`public.custom_access_token_hook`). RLS policies on every tenant table compare `company_id` against `public.current_company_id()`, which reads `auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'company_id'`. We do NOT use the handoff's raw-Postgres `SET LOCAL app.company_id` pattern — it fights Supabase's Data API/Realtime.
- **Every table in `public` has RLS enabled** (Supabase exposes `public` via the Data API; RLS-off = readable with the anon key). Tenant tables get the tenant-isolation policy; global tables (`companies` catalog, platform-admin data) get explicit admin-only policies.
- **`company_id` is `NOT NULL` + FK → `companies.id` + indexed** on every tenant table (the handoff `schema.ts` had it nullable with no FK — fixed during the port).
- **Data access uses `@supabase/ssr`** server clients carrying the user's session, so RLS applies to every query. **Drizzle is dropped** (the handoff suggested it, but it predates the Supabase decision; an ORM connecting as a privileged role would bypass RLS). TS types come from `supabase gen types`.
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth + a `public.users` profile row per `auth.users`, carrying `company_id` + role. Tenant ID is only ever read from the JWT — never from request body/params.
- **Schema lives in git** as Supabase CLI migrations under `supabase/migrations/`; the dashboard is not used to make schema changes. Build order: Wave 1 = isolation foundation + `customers`/`leads` slice + isolation test; Wave 2 = fan the same RLS treatment out to the remaining tables.

## Auth, onboarding & platform email — decided 2026-07-21

- **Auth = Supabase Auth**, email + password (login/reset designs: `design_handoff_vision_crm/45-sign-in.html`, `46a-reset-request.html`, `46b-reset-set-new.html`). No company/subdomain field on login — tenant comes from `public.users.company_id` → JWT.
- **Platform auth emails send from `support@getvision.uk` via the Resend API**, using the Supabase **Send Email Hook** → edge function `supabase/functions/send-auth-email` (NOT SMTP — chosen for full template control + tracking). Templates are Vision-branded in code and link to `/auth/confirm`. These are Vision-platform emails (login, reset, invite) and are SEPARATE from tenant marketing/customer emails, which send from each tenant's OWN domain set up inside the CRM (`email_domains`/`email_sender_addresses`). Never merge the two.
- **We never set user passwords.** Provisioning is invite-based: onboarding creates a **company + its first owner** (`company_admin`); that owner invites their staff via Supabase `inviteUserByEmail`, and each user sets their own password from the invite link. Platform admins never handle plaintext passwords.
- **Two onboarding doors, one data model:** (A) self-serve **free trial** — public signup creates a new company + owner with `plan='trial'` + `trial_ends_at`; (B) manual/sales provisioning creates the same. **License-per-seat** is enforced on invites: a company has `seat_limit`; inviting a user checks active users < `seat_limit`. Billing = Stripe per-seat (later).
- **Build now:** login + reset wired to Supabase Auth (Resend SMTP), entitlement columns on `companies`. **Defer to pre-launch:** self-serve trial signup UI, company-admin invite UI with seat enforcement, Stripe billing. Entitlement columns are added now so none of that is a retrofit.

## Hosting — decided 2026-07-21

- **The Next.js CRM deploys to Vercel.** The Supabase Auth email function (`send-auth-email`) stays on Supabase, not Vercel — two hosting homes by design.
- Production deploy checklist (env vars + Supabase Site URL/redirect allow-list, so reset links don't point at localhost) lives in `docs/auth-setup.md` § Deploying to Vercel.
- Tenant websites deploy to their own per-tenant Vercel projects via the Vercel API (see below), separate from the CRM deployment.

## AI website builder (future phase) — decided 2026-07-20

Tenants will build websites with AI inside the CRM and publish them to Vercel:

- **One Vercel project per tenant website, with its own deployments.** Do NOT use a shared multi-tenant sites app — this was considered and explicitly rejected.
- All Vercel interaction (project creation, deploys, custom domains, SSL) happens headlessly from the CRM backend via the Vercel REST API. Tenants must never see the Vercel dashboard or be redirected to Vercel.
- SEO split: the CRM itself must be noindexed and invisible to search engines; tenant websites must be SEO-first and rank on Google (custom domains, server-rendered HTML, per-site sitemaps/robots, LocalBusiness JSON-LD).
- Open question (deliberately deferred): where generated site code is stored — likely AI-generated files stored per-site in the CRM's storage (bucket/DB, versioned) and pushed to the tenant's Vercel project on each publish. Decide when the builder phase starts.
